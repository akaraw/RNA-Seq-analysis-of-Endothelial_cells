Error executing rule filter_uncorrected on cluster (jobid: 6, external: 173511.tinmgr2, jobscript: /gpfs1/scratch/30days/uqakaraw/76.RNAseq_Infection/swan/.snakemake/tmp.7kpc__3j/snakejob.filter_uncorrected.6.sh). For error details see the cluster log and the log files of the involved rule(s).
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
